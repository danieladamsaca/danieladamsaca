                              App Ideas
My app idea is a Overwatch gamer guid. The main concept of this app is to teach
new players the basics of the game. there will be a list of the characters you
can chose from, along with there abilities and how they work and there main
role for the game. i will also add in the character counters to help improve
your play.i will also be including layouts of all the maps as well a link
to the patch note page so users can read up on current or upcoming changes to
the game.I am also thinking about a community spotlight page to provide links
to online streams with informative videos to further improve your play. There
are a few apps out there that provide a similar service as this, so i am looking
use what i like from some and improve on the formate what else i feel is lacking.
